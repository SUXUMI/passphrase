# passphrase
Utility class to provide strings of short, easy to type words

It has Laravel dependencies since it uses the Cache facade to remember the array of parsed words.

## Usage
- Create a folder within app called `Utility`
- Place PassPhrase.php and wordlist.txt in this folder
- Call the passPhrase() function with the number of words and an optional seperator
